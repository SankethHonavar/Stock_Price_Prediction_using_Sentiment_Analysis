# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Sentiment Analysis 🧠💹

This project aims to predict the movement of **Tesla's stock price (TSLA)** using sentiment analysis on financial news headlines. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment scores and uses them to predict whether the stock price will go **up** or **down**.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Extracts and processes stock-related news data
- Performs sentiment analysis on headlines
- Combines sentiment with historical stock prices
- Uses machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression) for prediction
- Plots and visualizes trends and accuracy

---

## 📁 Dataset Used

- **Stock_prices.csv** — contains Tesla stock prices 
- **Tweets.csv** — contains tweets about Tesla

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- NLTK or TextBlob

---
